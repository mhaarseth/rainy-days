Cross course project at Noroff.

## Description

This assignment made us build a fictional webshop for a company called Rainy Days. We had to take into consideration the target audience.

This site is not functioning at the moment, bordering on broken, due to the products from the API no longer being available. When all is fixed, I will be working on adding a working cart. 

## Built With

- HTML
- CSS
- JS

## Getting Started
